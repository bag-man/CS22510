### C++ Assignment 1 - Ladybirds and Aphids simulation. 

This is my first attempt at making a project in C++, you can see the specification I was given in the docs folder. 

    Ladybirds and Aphids simulation.

    Usage:
      ./main [--config=<dir>] [--step]

    Options:
      -h --help       Show this screen.
      --version       Show version.
      --config=<dir>  Rirectory to load config files from [default: configs/].
      --step          Require enter press to step through animation, defaults to auto run.

    Configs:
      In the configs folder you need:
      
      * simulation.conf
      * aphids.conf
      * ladybirds.conf

      These will dictate the properties of the creatures and where they begin. 
      Check the docs folder for more information.
